# MagnifierApp
I am developing the Magnifier app for educational purpose in two weeks. Just to learn about ML basics and how to get Camera access.

I choose Magnifier for the camera access and for his design parts.
To develop this app I am watching the tutorial on: [https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/capturingphotos-camerapreview](https://www.neuralception.com/detection-app-tutorial-detector/)

My focus in this two weeks was to start a working project with a ML model, to get access to camera and improve my skills with SwiftUI.
I don't add an action to every button.

At the start i was struggling because I was trying to do it with SWiftUI and not with UIKit, but you must do it with UIKit,
because for the object detection you need to have multiples layer and there aren't layers in SwiftUI, but view.
